<p class="jp">There are so many ways The Flips Project could use help from the community.
  The most basic way to help would be for you to share our program with the people around you.
  In the past we have had trouble getting the word out to the community. There are Flyers
  posted at the bottom of the website (one with more information and one that is more visual)
   in pdf form that easily be posted on social media or online. They can also be printed and
    hung up at your local business, church, or in other community places. Feel free to post a
    link to our website on any social media or online community pages. We don’t have social media
    pages yet, but if you would like to help with that or have any suggestion please don’t
    hesitate to contact us.
</p>
<br>
<p class="jp">

  Community sponsors would make so much more possible for us. Right now, we have very few operating
  expenses (mainly safety insurance), but we also don’t have any source of income, which limits our
  outreach possibilities. We do not have a 501-c3 or tax exemption yet. However, sponsors and donations,
   which can be cash or by providing direct resources such as printing flyers or paying insurance, will
   make it possible for us to be sustainable and allow us to grow. In the future we would like to apply
   for a 501-c3 and be able to sponsor deserving gymnasts who have taken the class to continue gymnastics
   in OOA’s traditional offerings. Please contact us if you have a resource that could be beneficial our
   program, would like to donate, or would like to begin to navigate sponsoring a child with us. We would
   love to give sponsors and their businesses credit on our website as a way to thank you for your generosity.
</p>

Many hands make light work. Even with financial support and community awareness, there’s still organizing,
advertising, and coaching to be done. We would love to have someone fill the role of creating and running social
media for The Flips Project, which would be minimal work and very flexible, but would go a long way in getting
the word out to the community. We are constantly looking for more reliable coaches who have some experience with
gymnastics and are in high school or older. We have some experienced coaches who are great mentors, so you do not
have to have coached before, just a patient heart that’s ready to learn. We operate with two coaches for each
session as well as substitutes. We would love for you to be a part of this experience so please reach out if you
are interested!
